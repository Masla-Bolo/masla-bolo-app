# Masla Bolo

Masla Bolo is a community-driven mobile application developed in Flutter, aimed at empowering users to discuss, share, and seek solutions for various community and individual issues. The app is designed with a focus on modularity, scalability, and clean code principles, making it easy to maintain and extend.

## Features

- **Post Issues**: Users can create and share posts about their concerns or issues to discuss with the community.
- **Community Engagement**: Support for comments and likes on posts, encouraging active community participation.
- **Real-time Updates**: The app offers real-time updates for new posts, comments, and notifications.
- **User Authentication**: Secure user authentication to manage profiles and preferences.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Flutter (Dart)
- **State Management**: Bloc and Cubit
- **Architecture**: Clean Architecture
- **Backend**: Node.js / Firebase (Optional based on real-time requirements)
- **Database**: Firestore or any backend that supports real-time data updates

## Project Architecture

The application follows **Clean Architecture** principles, breaking down the project into distinct layers:

1. **Presentation Layer**: Contains UI components and widgets, which are managed by Bloc and Cubit for efficient state management.
2. **Domain Layer**: Includes business logic and use cases, separating core functionality from implementation details.
3. **Data Layer**: Manages data sources, such as REST APIs or databases, and includes repository implementations.

## Folder Structure

The project is organized as follows to support Clean Architecture principles:

```
lib/
├── core/                     # Core modules and utilities
├── data/                     # Data layer
│   ├── models/               # Data models
│   ├── repositories/         # Repository implementations
├── domain/                   # Domain layer
│   ├── entities/             # Domain entities
│   ├── usecases/             # Application use cases
├── presentation/             # Presentation layer
│   ├── blocs/                # BLoC and Cubit classes for state management
│   ├── screens/              # Screens and UI widgets
├── main.dart                 # App entry point
```

## State Management

Masla Bolo uses Bloc and Cubit to manage application states. **Bloc** is used for complex flows requiring multiple states and events, while **Cubit** is used for simpler, isolated states, making the app more responsive and organized.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK
- Dart SDK
- Firebase account (for backend and real-time functionality, if used)
