## Project Architecture

The application follows **Clean Architecture** principles, breaking down the project into distinct layers:

1. **Presentation Layer**: Contains UI components and widgets, which are managed by Bloc and Cubit for efficient state management.
2. **Domain Layer**: Includes abstractions and use cases, separating core functionality from implementation details.
3. **Data Layer**: Manages data sources, such as REST APIs or databases, and includes repository implementations.

## Folder Structure

The project is organized as follows to support Clean Architecture principles:

## State Management

Masla Bolo uses Bloc and Cubit to manage application states. **Bloc** is used for complex flows requiring multiple states and events, while **Cubit** is used for simpler, isolated states, making the app more responsive and organized.
